Hi Welcome.

This is a repository where I am uploading my finished free eBooks which will all be technical in scope and based on my own learning and notes. 

Please note that these eBooks are based on my own notes and will have multiple mistakes and shortcomings, don't depend on them for exam preparation and use the official materials from vendors and exam providers. Yo ucan use my eBooks as they were intended, for general understanding and knowledge. 

You can freely and optionally donate to my general efforts as an author but note that this is not a payment, commercial transaction or promise of commercialisation of any of the eBooks which are always available to you for free without payment. 
Donate here: https://ko-fi.com/idiro 

If you are a representative of a technological company or organisation and have any issues with these eBooks don't hesitate to contact me, I am happy to listen to any concerns.
